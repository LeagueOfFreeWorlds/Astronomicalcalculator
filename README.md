# Astronomicalcalculator
Basic Java calculator that is preprogrammed with formulas for physics, ranging from Kepler's Laws, to Gravitational Force. Currenty the program is very limited,
and comes with just a few formulas within a console interface. I will start working on a GUI so that the program is much friendlier to use.
